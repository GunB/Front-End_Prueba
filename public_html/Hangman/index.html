    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <div style="text-align:left">
      <p>You have to guess 50 random words, every 10 the word you have to guess increases 1 character.</p>
      <p>You need to call Game.start() a first time to load the words file (words.txt) and then call again Game.start() to actually start the game and get the first word you'll have to guess.</p>
      <p>Call Game.word() at any time to get the current word.</p>
      <p>You have 10 wrong guesses per word, once this limit is reached you have to get a new word by calling Game.next()</p>
      <p>At any time you can call Game.result() to generate the result page, but keep in mind is better if you do it at the end of the game</p>
      <p>
        Game.guess('a') => will guess the letter 'a', if the letter is found, it returns the current word
        with that letter revealed, if not, it returns:
        <ul>
          <li>true: if the word has been guess correctly</li>
          <li>false: if the letter is not present</li>
          <li>-1: if you send something different than one letter (+1 attempt)</li>
          <li>-2: if the allowed attemps have been reached</li>
          <li>-3: if you send a letter already guessed (+1 attempt)</li>
        </ul>
